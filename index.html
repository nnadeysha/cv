          <h3>ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
          <p>
            I'm 30 years old. I'm a student at RS-School, I study Java Script.
            I want to become a front-end developer.
            My priorities in work: interesting job where I can always progress, see the result of my work.
            My strengths: curiosity, perseverance, realism, sociability, optimism and purposefulness.
            Unfortunately, I have no experience in IT yet, I previously worked as the head of an online 
            store. We launched a new website for an online store and I worked a lot with the developers, 
            mainly I gave instructions to finalize the application and add new functionality. 
            It was then that I became interested in development.
